Spend the next 10 minutes decomposing the following problem (just decompose the problem, do not write any code to actually solve the problem for now):

Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should have two methods: `roll` which takes in the number of pins knocked down, and `score` which is called at the end and returns the total game score.

=begin
1. Create a placeholder for the name of each player. 
2. Name the array based off the name of the player so that you are able to append based off the turn. 
3. Collect the number of pins that every bowler has knocked down on the first turn.
4. Calculate the amount of points that the player has made on their turn. 
  Note that the rules have to follow the guidelines below: 
      Scoring is based on the number of pins you knock down. However, if you bowl a
      spare, you get to add the pins in your next ball to that frame. For strikes, you get
      the next two balls. 
5.Repeat this till every player has gone ten times. On the tenth frame; keep in mind that the player has some additional benefits for the following
      If you bowl a strike in the tenth frame, you get
      two more balls. If you throw a spare, you get one more ball.
6. Have the players do three rounds of ten
7. Announcing the winner: 

      Traditional Singles Bowling – This is Singles bowling. The Athlete’s score is
      based on a three game average. Add the total of all 3 games together and
      then divide by three for the three game average. The maximum score is 300.
